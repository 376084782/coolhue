# Installation
You can create your very own personalized collection of Gradient Palette with coolHue - 
1. Download the latest [coolHue v1.1.0 release archive](http://bit.ly/coolhue-v_1_1_0) from the repository's release section.
2. Unpack the archive and drag `index.html` in the browser, to check out the default gradient palette.
3. All the gradients which are visible in the browser by default are rendered by `colorData` Javascript Object.
4. You just need to update the `colorData` Object (array) to create your very own gradient palette. So, Open `index.html` in the text editor and update the color codes.
